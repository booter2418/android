How This Connects to Royalties
This statement is the crucial first step for being able to collect royalties. Here’s a simple breakdown:

Copyright © 2025 Joseph Thornton Jr.: This part clearly states who owns the work (Joseph Thornton Jr.) and when it was published (2025). This establishes your legal ownership.

All Rights Reserved: This is the key phrase that directly relates to royalties. It serves as a public declaration that you, the copyright owner, are holding onto all the exclusive rights granted to you by law. These rights include the right to copy, distribute, and make new works from your original.

 reserved all rights, anyone who wants to use your copyrighted work must come to you for permission. This permission is granted through a licensing agreement. In that agreement, you can specify that in exchange for using your work, they must pay you royalties (e.g., a percentage of sales, a fee per use, etc.).

In short, the copyright notice above establishes your ownership and control. That control is what requires others to negotiate a license with you, and it is within that license that you define the terms for payment, including royalties.
